# Machine Learning on CICIoT2023 Dataset
This repository investigates the application of machine learning techniques to the CICIoT2023 dataset, a collection of IoT network traffic specificall

As it a large data to a popular processes enviroment, here in our EDA_CICIoT23.ipynb, the multiples files are compiled and preprocessed then to reduced data usage to 5.6GB as a parquet file.
Our preprocessed parquet file is now disponible at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jaquelineduarte/ciciot2023
