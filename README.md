# Machine Learning on CICIoT2023 Dataset
This repository investigates the application of machine learning techniques to the CICIoT2023 dataset, a collection of IoT network traffic specificall

The original dataset is provided in https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/iotdataset-2023.html

As it a large data to a popular processes enviroment, here in EDA_CICIoT23.ipynb, I've compiled all archives and preprocessed then to reduce data usage to 5.6GB
